The next steps in your project should be:

1. **Create Entity Framework configurations** for all entities to define relationships, constraints, and indexes in your `UnifiedContract.Persistence` layer.

2. **Implement repositories** for each entity group following the repository pattern in your `UnifiedContract.Infrastructure` layer.

3. **Develop service implementations** for your existing interface contracts (like `IAuthService`, `IWorkOrderService`, etc.) in the application layer.

4. **Set up database migration** scripts to create your database schema.

5. **Implement API controllers** with proper DTOs for your frontend interactions.

6. **Configure authentication and authorization** with JWT as specified in your requirements.

7. **Add validation logic** using FluentValidation for your command/query handlers.

8. **Implement SignalR hubs** for real-time communication features.

### Areas for Enhancement of "Domain":

1. **Value Object Implementation**
   - Add input validation to value objects (e.g., validate currency codes, postal codes)
   - Consider making value objects immutable for better domain integrity

2. **Entity Relationships**
   - Consider adding more explicit documentation on relationships between entities
   - Use constants for string enumerations (e.g., "company" or "personal" for HomeType)

3. **Domain Logic**
   - Move business rules from configuration to domain entities where appropriate
   - Consider adding domain-specific methods to entities (e.g., `ApproveLeave()` on Leave entity)

4. **Identity Integration**
   - Create a proper Identity model rather than using generic object references
   - Define clear boundaries between the HR domain and Identity domain

5. **Nullability**
   - Review nullable properties (the project has nullable enabled)
   - Add appropriate null checks in domain logic

6. **Domain Events**
   - Consider implementing domain events for important state changes
   - This would enable better separation between domains and facilitate eventual consistency

Would you like me to implement any of these enhancements or continue building other aspects of the project?
